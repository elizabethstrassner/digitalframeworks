PRINCE HARRY'S WEDDING TO MEGHAN MARKLE AMONG THE MOST EXPENSIVE CELEBRITY NUPTUALS IN HISTORY

LONDON — Prince Harry tied the knot Saturday with Meghan Markle in a lavish ceremony watched by people around the globe. Every detail of the occasion — from the bride's modest Givenchy gown to the song selection during the service — was duly noted by royal-watchers worldwide. In sum, *Fortune* estimates that the day's festivities cost about $45 million, with a large chunk of that going to security costs. 

The widely watched royal wedding was the second in a decade — Harry's older brother, Prince William, married Kate Middleton in a 2011 ceremony that drew just as much international attention. Although William is to inherit the throne, his wedding actually cost less than his brother's — $34 million, according to wedding website Brides.com. 



But royal marriages are not the only times when the public is seized by wedding fever. Celebrity weddings have long been a cause for celebration, attention, and big TV ratings. In some cases, as for the royals, wedding costs are largely driven by hefty security fees. British newspaper *the Telegraph* estimates that when William and Harry's mother, Princess Diana, wed their father Prince Charles in 1981, the wedding cost $39.9 million — seemingly less than the brothers' weddings, but an estimated $110 million when adjusted for inflation. The biggest single cost of that ceremony? Security, according to a CBS report.

Without a royal family of their own, Americans flock to their television sets to watch the weddings of entertainment celebrities. Reality TV star Kim Kardashian has had two of the most expensive weddings in history. Her first, to basketball player Kris Humphries, infamously lasted just 72 days; her second, to Grammy winner Kanye West, was significantly cheaper. Other big-name celebrities with luxurious weddings include Liza Minnelli and Michael Jordan, whose weddings cost $3.5 and $10 million, respectively.

Former First Daughter Chelsea Clinton is another kind of American royalty; at her $5 million ceremony, at least $200,000 went to security fees.

The average American, predictably, ties the knot in a much less luxurious fashion. According to bridal website TheKnot.com, the average US wedding costs a little over $32,000 — much less than the celebrity weddings that make headlines, but likely not a minor cost for the young couples and parents who are footing the bill!
