TRUMP HOTELS MAKE OVER 600,000 FROM CAMPAIGNS SINCE START OF 2017

Before becoming president, Donald Trump was internationally famous for his sprawling business, including many companies that bear the Trump name. Unlike his predecessors, Trump refused to divest from his company before taking office. This was a significant departure from precedent — former president Jimmy Carter even famously divested from his peanut farm — and has raised concerns among ethics and constitutional law experts.

Although the Trump business empire has, throughout the years, included properties like Trump steaks and even Trump vodka (although the president himself famously does not drink), perhaps the best known Trump properties are the Trump International Hotels. One of the most famous of these is in Washington, DC, and is often the subject of protests, including a recent incident in which activists protested an image of crime scene tape on the famous hotel.

But the Trump hotel chain appears to also be a significant beneficiary of its namesake's political reputation: since 2017, according to FEC filings, hundreds of thousands of dollars have gone from Republican campaigns to Trump hotels, including funding from the president's own campaign. 

In total, an estimated $667,890 has been transferred from PACs and campaigns to the president's hotels. Over $100,000 of of that figure came from the president's own reelection campaign to Trump properties in DC, New York, and Nevada. Another $299,394 came directly from the Republican National Committee, largely for fundraising. The RNC made headlines in March when it announced its plans to hold its annual spring meeting at Trump National Doral Miami, a Trump resort in Florida.
