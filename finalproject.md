# LAW SCHOOL APPLICATIONS RISE — IS THIS THE SIGN OF A “TRUMP BUMP?”

## Elizabeth Strassner

WASHINGTON — In what may be one of the strangest side effects of the Trump presidency, some legal industry experts attribute a large spike in law school applications to the controversial Commander-in-Chief.

Although the application season for the 2018-2019 law school academic year is months away from being over, key indicators have shown a significant increase in applicants. In January, the Law School Admissions Council [reported]( http://www.abajournal.com/files/LSAC_January_Newsletter_(1).pdf) a 9.5 percent increase in the number of applicants and a 27.9 percent increase in the number of people who took the December 2017 LSAT exam. Officials at Harvard Law School, which completed its review of applications on May 1 of this year, reported a 30 percent increase from the previous season.

While the increase in applications could be attributed to a variety of factors, including modest gains made in the legal employment market in recent years, one popular theory holds that this spike is a so-called [“Trump Bump;”]( http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/the_trump_bump_for_law_school_applicants_is_real_and_significant_survey_say) namely, that applicants are choosing to go to law school as a reaction to the election and presidency of Donald Trump.

There seems to be some evidence for this theory: a Kaplan Test Prep survey of law school applicants conducted in February 2018 [found]( http://press.kaptest.com/press-releases/kaplan-test-prep-survey-30-percent-pre-law-students-say-results-2016-election-impacted-decision-apply-law-school) that 32 percent of students said that the results of the 2016 presidential election impacted their decision to attend law school. 

“I decided to go to law school because of the 2016 election,” said one survey respondent, “Somebody has to hold these politicians accountable, and it’s clearly not anyone in office right now. Also, if Hillary isn’t gonna be the first female president, then it’s going to be me.”

Spivey Consulting, a group of former law school admissions officers who help would-be law students shape their applications, noted in a recent [statement]( https://blog.spiveyconsulting.com/predicting-the-2018-2019-law-school-admissions-cycle-2/) that many applicants are even detailing their anti-Trump motivations in their applications: “Our friends and colleagues in admissions offices nationally have been referencing the extreme number of election-based personal statements.”

With a reality TV star in the White House, it seems almost logical that some of America’s newest big-name celebrities come not from the studios of Hollywood but from quiet, fluorescent-lit law offices in the nation’s capital. 

The election of President Donald Trump may have shocked millions of left-leaning Americans, but it also galvanized them to follow politics more closely than ever before. Rather than fighting unpopular policies in the halls of Congress, many of the president’s most controversial acts have been battled in the courtroom. Suddenly, the names that were trending big on Twitter weren’t Kim Kardashian and Nicki Minaj but people like former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, former U.S. Attorney and current podcast host Preet Bharara — and, of course, Special Counsel Robert Mueller. 

However, it is far from clear that the president is the sole cause of this increase. Although the percentage of law school graduates with full-time legal jobs has not risen dramatically in the years that the American Bar Association has tracked this [data]( https://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_education/resources/statistics.html) (since 2012), there have been modest gains, meaning that law school may be less of a gamble now than it was five years ago.

In Los Angeles, one of the largest legal markets in the country, large law firms were employing as many attorneys as they did before the recession by January 2017, according to a [recent study](http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/files/lmi-park-report.pdf) by the Lowell Milken Institute for Business Law and Policy at UCLA.

Alternatively, the president’s effect might have been more indirect than the Kaplan survey data indicates. Some students may have been working on left-leaning campaigns from which job prospects did not arrive, or work in federal offices where budgets are set to be slashed. 

“Does Trump make me mad? Sure. Did I apply because of him? No,” says a State Department employee who will attend the law school this fall at the University of California at Berkeley. (Federal employees quoted in this article requested anonymity because they are still employed by the government.) He says that part of his desire to leave his current position comes from changes implemented by the new administration, including its significant staffing cuts: “Do I want to keep working on projects for the feds where my points of contact keep changing, because there’s nobody at State? No.”

“Hmm, the work you want to do is going to change [or] not exist for a bit, may be a good time to go to grad school,” said a 23-year-old federal government employee who plans to attend the University of Michigan Law School this fall.  “I would really, really love to work on revising federal tax policy to make it more progressive, but that hasn’t really gone so well recently.”

Even if Trump is behind the mass exodus from the working world and into graduate legal education, some experts still do not expect the “Trump Bump” to last, even into the 2018-2019 application cycle.

“The bump was a psychological state reaction, not a groundswell ‘go to law school’ movement that happened over time,” argued the experts at Spivey Consulting. “A number of people were hot over the surprising election result and decided to apply… that was a bounce that won’t spike applications this coming cycle.”
