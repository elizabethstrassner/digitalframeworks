__[Extensive Data Shows Punishing Reach of Racism for Black Boys](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class-white-and-black-men.html), *New York Times*, March 19, 2018.__


**What is this story about?**
This story has been everywhere over the last few weeks, and it's easy to understand why. The use of graphics is incredibly compelling — particularly the moving graphic that shows how people move among economic classes throughout their lives. 

It's kind of a behemoth article — the data they are using comes from an enormous study done by researchers at Harvard, Stanford, and the Census Bureau. The data seems to have come from a [variety of sources](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/data/), including censuses and university research.

The *Times* article, like the university researchers, concludes that the racial income disparity (and, more specifically, income *mobility* disparity) is incredibly stark among men but much less so among women. This raises some really interesting questions about the ways in which racism is experienced in a gendered way. Intersectionality has been a commonly discussed topic among identity theorists (and Twitter activists), especially in recent years, but this data hints that black men are experiencing racism in a unique, negative way that is not as frequently discussed. 

I think this is a great example of how data can drive reporting, rather than the other way around — there are all sorts of questions that flow from the *Times*' story that could inspire future articles. 
1. Are there industries where anti-black male racism is more severe than others? 
2. Are there specific ages at which this racism is particularly pernicious? 
3. Can the effect of the so-called "school-to-prison pipeline" be quantified? 

**Useful infographics** |
This story is, to me, an excellent example of how well-made graphics can contribute to a story. In addition to the initial piece, the *Times* also published a series related to the topic, including [one article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/27/upshot/make-your-own-mobility-animation.html) that enables the reader to toggle the mobility chart for any combination of race and gender.

Another startling infographic modeled the percent chance of incarceration for a given boy compared with how much money his parents make. The graphic showed that black boys whose parents are in the top 1 percent are as likely to be incarcerated as a white boy whose parents make $36,000 annually.
