# Assignment 3: April 18, 2018

First ladies have a unique, if somewhat antiquated, role in any given presidential administration. In many cases, they function as diplomatic representatives of the United States, putting an agreeable face on the United States, particularly in terms of foreign policy. Photo ops with key foreign leaders are a major component of the work first ladies do. In recent years, it has become common for those first ladies to make a gesture of support for foreign leaders by wearing clothing designed by people from that nation.

For example, in a recent, much talked-about appearance with her husband, the French president (Macron), and his wife, U.S. first lady Melania Trump wore a suit by American designer Michael Kors, paired with a hat by French fashion house Dior. 

My data set will examine the clothing worn by first ladies at key state appearances to see whether one recent first lady is more "diplomatic" than another. It could also answer other interesting questions - is Michelle Obama partial to Japanese fashion? Does Melania prefer to wear American and accessorize with foreign-designed items? Did Laura Bush only wear U.S. fashion after 9/11? Do countries' fashion fall out of favor as relations worsen?  

Here are the features I will be considering:
* Name of first lady
* Date of head of state visit
* Country of origin of head of state
* Name of head of state
* Designer/house of primary outfit (suit, dress, etc.)
* Country of origin of that designer/house
* Designer/house of prominent or relevant accessory (hat, shoes, bag, if applicable)
* Country of origin of that designer/house

I will collect this data by reviewing government records about meetings with state leaders and reviewing press coverage for first lady apparel. I am planning to collect Laura Bush through Melania Trump, but may extend further backwards if I find compelling content.
