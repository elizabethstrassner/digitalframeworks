**Key Question: What is the booziest county in Missouri?**
Looking at [state licensing data](https://data.mo.gov/Regulatory/Missouri-Primary-Alcohol-Licenses/d9fr-pncw) for alcohol distributors, the story will aim to parse out which MO county has the highest number of licensed alcohol distributors per capita. 

**Why can this data be trusted?**
This data appears to be extremely trustworthy for a number of reasons. First, and most obviously, the data comes from a government source, in this case the state of Missouri and the data.mo.gov website. The .gov extension confirms that the website, which proports to be a government source, actually is one. Licensing data for local alcohol distributors is something we can reasonably expect the state to have, because they administer those licenses. 

As a native Missourian, I checked the data set for a few key points I remembered from my visits home. Tucker's Place West in Manchester, Missouri, a place I often visited with my family, appears on the list; the information listed in that entry appears to be correct. I also checked for a few other local favorites (Dressel's, Sportsman's Park) and franchise/chain restaurants (Cheesecake Factory, The Pasta House). All checked out, with entries that were consistent with what I knew about the locations during my 18 years in Missouri.

I also looked for possible data points that would help me understand how the set was defined. Most of the above locations also serve food, so I looked up bars that I knew did not serve food (Talayna's, The Famous Bar) to determine that those were included in the data set as well, which they were.

A quick search for all licensed locations in my hometown (Frontenac) showed just 12 places — but this is consistent with the small size of my largely residential community. To my knowledge, all locales that serve alcohol were accounted for.

It is also important to note that this dataset includes companies that are licensed in Missouri but which are not actually located in the Show-Me State. All of these appear to be wineries, breweries, distilleries, or other producers of spirits. This data might not be useful for my story, but it is important to understand that it exists within the overall data set.
